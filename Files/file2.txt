The Python string data type is a sequence made up of one or more individual characters consisting of letters, numbers, whitespace characters, or symbols. Strings are sequences and can be accessed in the same ways as other sequence-based data types, through indexing and slicing. This tutorial will guide you through how to access strings through indexing and how to slice them through their character sequences; it will also cover counting and character location methods.
